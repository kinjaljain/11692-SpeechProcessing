welcome: Welcome to memory game. I'm going to say three numbers for you to repeat backwards. Ready?

win_1: Good job! Would you like to play again?
win_2: Congratulations! You are correct! Would you like to play again?
win_3: Awesome! Do you want to play again?

ask_question_1: Can you repeat the numbers {{ numbers|join(", ") }} backwards?
ask_question_2: Please repeat the numbers {{ numbers|join(", ") }} backwards?
ask_question_3: Could you please repeat the numbers {{ numbers|join(", ") }} backwards?

lose_1: Sorry, that's the wrong answer. Would you like to play again?
lose_2: I'm afraid that's not correct! Would you like to start over?
lose_3: Oops, wrong answer! Do you want to play again?

end: Okay, Bye! See you next time!
